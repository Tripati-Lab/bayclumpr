# The `bayclumpr` `R` Package

### Bayesian methods for clumped isotope paleothermometry


## What is `bayclumpr`?

To support the use of Bayesian models and the analytical framework developed in Rom√°n-Palacios et al. (2022) for clumped isotope calibration and for temperature reconstructions, and to facilitate comparisons of Bayesian and classical models, we present a self-contained R package and associated Shiny Dashboard application, `bayclumpr` and `BayClump`, respectively. `bayclumpr` (and `BayClump`) fits both classical and Bayesian linear regressions to calibration datasets and performs temperature reconstructions under frequentist and Bayesian frameworks.
